        Hello, welcome to my website. I am Chiemela, a full stack developer and U.S Army
        veteran. I am proficient with the MERN stack,
        but I also learn many technologies and add them to my skill set.
        Outside of work, I enjoy playing chess, working out, and attending music
        concerts.
