        Hey! Thank you for visiting my website. My name is Chiemela. I am a U.S Army veteran and full stack developer. I build my projects mostly with PERN stack, however, I am interested in learning about the different technologies out there. Outside of work, I enjoy playing chess, working out and attending music festivals.
