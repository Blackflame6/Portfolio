        Hello! Welcome to my website. My name is Chiemela. The fascination with
        how computers work drove me from Mechanical Engineering to Computer
        Science at the University of Houston, (Go Coogs! üêæ). Outside of work, I enjoy playing
        chess, working out, and attending music concerts.
